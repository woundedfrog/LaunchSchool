QUESTION:
What is the block's return value in the following code? Why?

[1, 2, 3].map do |num|
  if num > 1
    puts num
  else
    num
  end
end


ANSWER:

The return value is: 
 => [1, nil, nil]
 
 This is because on the first iteration, the else condition is met and the `num` is returned, which is `1`.
 The second and third(last) iterations `nil` is returned because the `if` condition is met. 
 Inside the if clause, we find `puts num`. This will print the number, but will return nil. PUTS always returns nil.
