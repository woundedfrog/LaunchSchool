QUESTION:

What is the return value of the select method below? Why?


[1, 2, 3].select do |num|
  num > 5
  'hi'
end


ANSWER:
# `select` method only cares about the truthiness of the return value in the block.
#'hi' is a `truthy` value and is the last line of code in the block, the select method will select every element in the original array.
