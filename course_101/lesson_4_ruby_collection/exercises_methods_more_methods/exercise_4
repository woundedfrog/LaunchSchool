QUESTIOn:

What is the return value of each_with_object in the following code? Why?

['ant', 'bear', 'cat'].each_with_object({}) do |value, hash|
  hash[value[0]] = value
end

ANSWER:

=> { "a" => "ant", "b" => "bear", "c" => "cat" }

`eatch_with_object` takes in an object as an argument.
This argument is passed into the block and is returned at the end of each itteration. The object is modified within the block.
Thus when the iteration over the calling collection ends, the modified object is returned.
