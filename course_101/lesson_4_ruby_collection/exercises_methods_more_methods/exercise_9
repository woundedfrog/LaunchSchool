QUESTION:

What is the return value of map in the following code? Why?

{ a: 'ant', b: 'bear' }.map do |key, value|
  if value.size > 3
    value
  end
end


ANSWER:

.map returns an array type collection.
=> [nil,'ant']

On the first iteration, the if condition is not met, and `nil` is returned; On the second iteration, the if condition is met and the `value` is returned.
