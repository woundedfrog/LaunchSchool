QUESTION:

What is the return value of the following statement? Why?

['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop.size

ANSWER:

=> 11

'11' is returned because the `pop` method that's called on the array removes the last element from that array and returns it. 
Then the .size is called on that returned value and returns 11.

pop => returns 'caterpillar'
.size => return `11`, because caterpillar is 11 characters long.
