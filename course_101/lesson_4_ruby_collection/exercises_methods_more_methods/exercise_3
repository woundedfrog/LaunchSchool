QUESTION:
What is the return value of reject in the following code? Why?

[1, 2, 3].reject do |num|
  puts num
end

ANSWER:

#reject checks the return value of the block. If the block returns true, the item is not selected. In this code example, `puts num` has a return value of 'ni'. 
NIL is a falsy value, so the elements are selected.
