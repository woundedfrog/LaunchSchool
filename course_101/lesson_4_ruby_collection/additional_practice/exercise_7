QUESTION:

Create a hash that expresses the frequency with which each letter occurs in this string:


statement = "The Flintstones Rock"
ex:

{ "F"=>1, "R"=>1, "T"=>1, "c"=>1, "e"=>2, ... }

#ANSWER:

frequency = Hash.new(0)

statement.split("").each do |value|
	frequency[value] += 1 if value =~ /[a-zA-Z]/
end
frequency.sort.to_h

#The .sort is to order the values inside the hash => a multilayered array is returned. The .to_h is to turn the multilayered array back into a HASH.

This is unnecessary code.
