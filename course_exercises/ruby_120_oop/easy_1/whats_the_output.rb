#What's the Output?
#
#Take a look at the following code:

class Pet
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name.to_s
  end

  def to_s
    @name.upcase!
    "My name is #{@name}."
  end
end

name = 'Fluffy'
fluffy = Pet.new(name)
puts fluffy.name
puts fluffy
puts fluffy.name
puts name


#What output does this code print? Fix this class so that there are no surprises waiting in store for the unsuspecting developer.

#Fluffy
#My name is FLUFFY.
#FLUFFY
#FLUFFY

class Pet
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name.to_s
  end

  def to_s
    "My name is #{@name.upcase}."
  end
end
