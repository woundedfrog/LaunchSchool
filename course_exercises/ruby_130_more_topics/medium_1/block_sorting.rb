#Bubble Sort with Blocks
#
#In an earlier exercise, you were asked to construct a #bubble_sort! method that used the bubble sort algorithm to sort Arrays in place. Our solution was this:

#The problem with this solution is that it doesn't give you any freedom in terms of the criteria used for the sort. For example, perhaps you want to sort the Array in reverse order from usual, or perhaps you want to sort a list of names in a case-insensitive manner.
#
#Your task in this assignment is to modify #bubble_sort! so it takes an optional block that determines which of two consecutive blocks will appear first in the results.
#
#If you still have a copy of your #bubble_sort! method, you may use that method as the basis for this exercise. Otherwise, you can use the above solution.
#
#Examples:


def bubble_sort!(array)
  loop do
    swapped = false
    1.upto(array.size - 1) do |index|
      if block_given?
        next if yield(array[index-1], array[index])
      else
        next if array[index - 1] <= array[index]
      end

      array[index - 1], array[index] = array[index], array[index - 1]
    swapped = true
    end
    break unless swapped
  end
  nil
end



array = [5, 3]
bubble_sort!(array)
p array == [3, 5]

array = [5, 3, 7]
bubble_sort!(array) { |first, second| first >= second }
p array == [7, 5, 3]

array = [6, 2, 7, 1, 4]
bubble_sort!(array)
p array == [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]

array = [6, 12, 27, 22, 14]
bubble_sort!(array) { |first, second| (first % 7) <= (second % 7) }
p array == [14, 22, 12, 6, 27]

array = %w(sue Pete alice Tyler rachel Kim bonnie)
bubble_sort!(array)
p array == %w(Kim Pete Tyler alice bonnie rachel sue)

array = %w(sue Pete alice Tyler rachel Kim bonnie)
bubble_sort!(array) { |first, second| first.downcase <= second.downcase }
p array == %w(alice bonnie Kim Pete rachel sue Tyler)

#Further Exploration

#Modify your solution so it only passes one element to the block at a time; the block should perform some sort of transformation to the argument, and #bubble_sort! itself should just use <= to compare two values. In other words, you should be able to call #bubble_sort! like this:


def bubble_sort!(array)
  loop do
    swapped = false
    1.upto(array.size - 1) do |index|
      if block_given?
        #next if yield(array[index-1], array[index])
      #else
        next if yield(array[index - 1]) <= yield(array[index])
      end

      array[index - 1], array[index] = array[index], array[index - 1]
    swapped = true
    end
    break unless swapped
  end
  nil
end
