#What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal

#ANSWER:
#"Breakfast" will be printed because it is being returned by the 'return' method.
#    Methods always return the return value of the last line, but using return is the only way to make sure a specific return value is returned.
