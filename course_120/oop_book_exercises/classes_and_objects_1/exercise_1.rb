#Create a class called MyCar. When you initialize a new instance or object of the class, allow the user to define some instance variables that tell us the year, color, and model of the car. Create an instance variable that is set to 0 during instantiation of the object to track the current speed of the car as well. Create instance methods that allow the car to speed up, brake, and shut the car off.


class MyCar
  
  def initialize(year,color,model)
    @year = year
    @color = color
    @model = model
    @current_speed = 0
  end

  def speed_up(number)
    @current_speed += number
    puts "You push the gas and the car accelerates to #{number} mph!"
  end

  def brake(number)
    @current_speed -= number
    puts "You hit the brakes and the car decelerates #{number} mph!"
